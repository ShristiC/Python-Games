# Python-Games
Some Classic Games Developed on Python 3

## Idea Source
As part of the Udemy Course: 2021 Complete Python Bootcamp from Zero to Hero in Python

## Game Development
Thus far, I have developed 3 games in Python - but are all the simple versions. 

Card Game:
- Blackjack 
- War

Arcade Game:
- Tic Tac Toe

Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions regarding the development. 

In the future, as time permits, the plan is to develop more complex version of the games and maybe
embed some form of terminal AI game architecture.
