https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_(card_game) 

This is a project as part of the 2nd milestone project of the Udemy Python Course

How it works:

1. Start with a 52 Card Deck
2. Split the Deck Evenly into two decks - 26 cards each
3. Pick a card from each deck and compare --> card with higher rank wins
4. Winner of the round takes both cards and adds it to the deck
5. If there is a tie --> take out an additional n set of cards, and redraw two cards and go back to step 3
6. game won when a player wins all the cards in the deck


Game Construction:
- Classes: Card, Deck, Player, Game Logic
- Goal is to simulate a game between 2 computer players --> possible add ons : human players and competitive levels --> possible AI and RL after?
